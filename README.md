## About me

Hey, I'm Rinkit Adhana, an undergraduate Computer Science student and full-stack developer who loves building and shipping things.

I mainly work with React.js, Next.js, and Node.js for both frontend and backend, using TypeScript alongside them. I have created many cool projects using these technologies.
