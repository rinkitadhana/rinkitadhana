# Hey there, I'm Rinkit Adhana aka Gruz
### About me
- I'm a full stack developer who loves building clean, modern websites and apps where design, functionality, and even the smallest details matter, with a focus on making products that are both practical and visually satisfying.
- Tech stack isn't my concern, I'm flexible with whatever the project needs, though I prefer modern frameworks and tools. I'm always open for new opportunities to learn and grow.
- If you love what i build and do, then please consider sponsoring me.
