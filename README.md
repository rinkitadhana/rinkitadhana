## About me

Greetings! I'm Rinkit Adhana, currently in my second year pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology. My passion lies in full-stack web development, where I thrive on crafting dynamic and user-centric digital experiences.

My expertise encompasses a wide array of programming languages and tools, including Java, C, and C++, alongside proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Embracing the full-stack paradigm, I am adept in both front-end and back-end technologies, leveraging frameworks like EJS for templating, SQL and PostgreSQL for database management, and Node.js with Express.js for server-side development.
