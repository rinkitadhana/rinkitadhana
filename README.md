## About me

Hey, I'm Rinkit Adhana, a third-year student exploring the field of engineering. I live in Delhi, India, and I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things and learning something new every day from them. I mainly work with React and Tailwind for frontend development and Express and MongoDB for backend. As a computer science student, I'm also skilled in data structures and algorithms and practice my problem-solving skills daily. I'm looking for opportunities in both web development and software engineering roles.
