## About me

Hey, I’m Rinkit Adhana, an undergraduate computer science student and a full-stack developer based in Delhi, India. I’m passionate about building and shipping cool, practical projects that people actually use. My expertise lies in working with technologies like React, Next.js, and Node.js for both frontend and backend development. Over time, I’ve built numerous projects using these tools and am constantly working on new ones to expand my skills. As a computer science student, I also have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, and I make it a point to sharpen my problem-solving abilities daily.
